#PixelBrush
&emsp; It's a little tools for painting a pixel picture.
The reason for wanting to make such a software is I want to make a little game.And I need much picture like pixel picture.

&emsp; What I need is simple.But other pixel painting tools are complex.So I wanted to make a simple one myself.

&emsp; And if you find it here, the goal is to find a drawing software.If you want to make your production prefect in workmanship.May be the professional *software* **GraphicsGale** is more suitable for you.

&emsp; In this tools,I use **python3** to do it.
The image processing is adopted with **OpenCV**.An open source graphics image processing library.The reason of use OpenCV,that I am familiar with OpenCV, on the other hand, its powerful function can facilitate my future posible expansion.And the GUI is use **wxpython**.

&emsp; Now,I have this following result.
